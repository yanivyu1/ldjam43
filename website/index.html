        "Zap! Bow! Take that, troll face!" Billy yelled to himself while playing with his toys. "No monster gets away from Sir Awesome Man!"<br/><br/>
        Sir Awesome Man is the greatest hero ever! He is a knight that gets to travel to far-away lands and engage in epic battles.<br/><br/>
        If only Billy's life was more like Sir Awesome Man!<br/><br/>
        But in reality, his mom disrupts his adventures every single night...<br/><br/>
        "Billy, what happened to your room?! It's like a bombshell exploded in here! You'd better clean it all up by the time I get back!"</br><br/>
        But not tonight! No messy room is important enough - Awesomeland City must be defended, and only Sir Awesome Man is brave enough to do it!

        Billy is stuck having to clean his room. He'd much rather let his imagination drift to a far away land, though.<br/>
        You control Billy and his favorite hero, Sir Awesome Man. Careful, though - the child and the hero are connected!
